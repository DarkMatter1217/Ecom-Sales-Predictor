# Amazon Sales Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes and explores a large Amazon Sales dataset, focusing on understanding sales performance, order statuses, product details, shipment statuses, and other key business insights. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter notebook using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data exploration and visualization.

## Features

- **Dataset Loading \& Cleaning**:
Loads sales data (`Amazon Sale Report.csv`) with attention to potential column type mismatches and missing values.
- **Comprehensive Data Exploration**:
    - Overview of columns, missing data, and value counts.
    - Unique value counts and sample values for every column.
    - Column-wise breakdown into new user-friendly names and cleaned formats.
- **Data Transformation**:
    - Renaming columns for clarity and ease of use (e.g., `Order ID` â†’ `order_ID`).
    - Date formatting and extraction of time features.
    - Creation of derived variables like month names, log transformations, promotion flags, and customer type flags.
- **Descriptive Statistics**:
    - Summary statistics for numerical and categorical features.
    - Distribution and frequency statistics for sales amount, quantity, cities, states, product categories, etc.
    - Detailed analysis of cancellation, fulfillment, and shipment statuses.
- **Visualization**:
    - Utilizes seaborn and matplotlib for clear, aesthetic visuals.
    - Plots to inspect sales trends, product performance, etc.
- **Prepared for Further Analytics \& Modeling**:
    - Cleaned dataframe (`df`) ready for business intelligence or further modeling tasks.
